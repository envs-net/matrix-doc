## Delete rooms and leave rooms

When leaving rooms, they no longer appear in the room list (left column). If the last person in the room leaves the room, the room is still in the archive for 7 days, but is then permanently deleted.

As administrator, all room members should first be "kicked" (removed from the room), then the person is the last to leave the room and thus initiates the later deletion by the server.

!!! note
	Before you delete the room you can export the room history e.g. into a `.txt`, `.html` or `.json` file ..
