# Use spaces as room filters

All matrix users of the client element (and a few other clients) can use spaces (communities replacement) to filter different rooms, which may be lost or scattered in the room list on the left.

Spaces can only be created for yourself or for others (if you invite them into a space) and create a superordinate structure for rooms. For example, for a semester group/study group or for a chair team etc.

Existing rooms can be assigned to a space in the space settings.

A space created with the + button can be drag'n'dropped from the spaces avatar (little picture) onto the sidebar.

A small text can be used to describe the space.

A space can be deleted when the administrator leaves it.
