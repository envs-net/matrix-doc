# Why matrix as a chat system?

There are many services and programs for instant electronic communication. Matrix was chosen because it has the following characteristics:

- Open standard (no technical dead end)
- Communication protocol for federated real-time communication (no isolated solution but like e-mail with worldwide connectivity)
- Differentiated communication possible (1:1, multiple teams, topic-specific)
- Decentralized, persistent and interoperable communication (no central control instances, connectable with other protocols and tools)
- Data protection: end-to-end encryption standard in 1:1 conversations and (group) rooms, can be switched off in the latter
- Web application + desktop client + mobile apps available
  - The contacts on your own cell phone are not automatically passed on to third parties (no address book upload)
- Connection to existing authentication systems (e.g. TU Dresden)
- Existing successful security audit
- Autonomy and control: locally installable (server location TU Dresden)
- Recognize the presence status
- Active further development
- Up-and-coming use by other scientific institutions (e.g. lots of German universities)
