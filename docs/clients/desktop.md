## Element Desktop

Downloads for: [:fontawesome-solid-download: Windows](https://packages.riot.im/desktop/install/win32/x64/Element%20Setup.exe){ .md-button } [:fontawesome-solid-download: macOS](https://packages.riot.im/desktop/install/macos/Element.dmg){ .md-button } [:fontawesome-solid-download: Linux](/clients/install_linux){ .md-button }

After a desktop installation, make sure to use the existing account or create a new account on the envs.net homeserver. Here the example of Element:

![Selected login button in the element matrix client](/images/01_Login_en.png "Selected login button in the element matrix client")

This is done by clicking on **Edit**. Then you will not accidentally end up on the wrong server...

![Change login page with focus on the homeserver button](/images/02_Change-Homeserver_en.png "Change login page with focus on the homeserver button")

Now you can manually specify the homeserver: `matrix.envs.net`

![Input field to change the homeserver with the input matrix.envs.net](/images/03_Set-Homeserver_en.png "Input field to change the homeserver with the input matrix.envs.net")

Afterwards the one-time login with Username and Password must be carried out:

![Login window with request to enter Username and Password](/images/04_Username_en.png "Login window with request to enter Username and Password")

By activating the slider under `All Settings` > `Preferences` > **`Start automatically after system login`**, the element client starts after every reboot and you no longer miss any notifications due to accidentally closing the browser tab in the usage variant with the Web App.
