## Element Desktop

Downloads for: [:fontawesome-solid-download: Windows](https://packages.riot.im/desktop/install/win32/x64/Element%20Setup.exe){ .md-button } [:fontawesome-solid-download: macOS](https://packages.riot.im/desktop/install/macos/Element.dmg){ .md-button } [:fontawesome-solid-download: Linux](/clients/install_linux){ .md-button }

After a desktop installation, make sure to use the existing account or create a new account on the envs.net homeserver. Here the example of Element:

This is done by clicking on **Change**. Then you will not accidentally end up on the wrong server...

Now you can manually specify the home server: `matrix.envs.net`

Afterwards the one-time login with Username and Password must be carried out:

By activating the slider under `All Settings` > `Preferences` > **`Automatic start after system login`**, the element client starts after every reboot and you no longer miss any notifications due to accidentally closing the browser tab in the usage variant with the Web App.
