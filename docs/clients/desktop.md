After a desktop installation, make sure to use the existing account with the ZIH login and not to create a new account on another server. Here the example of Element:

This is done by clicking on **Change**. Then you will not accidentally end up on the wrong server...

Now you can manually specify the home server: tu-dresden.de

![Input field to change the home server with the input matrix.tu-dresden.de](/images/03_Set-Homeserver_en.png)

Afterwards the one-time login with ZIH login and ZIH password must be carried out:

By activating the slider under Settings > Settings > "**Automatic start after system login**", the element client starts after every reboot and you no longer miss any notifications due to accidentally closing the browser tab in the usage variant with the Web App.
